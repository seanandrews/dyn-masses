Stellar parameters:
-------------------
used Dartmouth (non-magnetic) model parameters at 2 Myr


Temperatures:
-------------
Simple Chiang & Goldreich type of model for midplane:

Tmid = (0.02 * Lstar / 8 * pi * r**2 * sigma_sb)**0.25

Set surface temperatures to be Tatm = 2.5 * Tmid, somewhat arbitrarily.

I then used the Dullemond et al. 2020 (Appendix D) vertical temperature 
prescription to connect the midplane and surface smoothly, with hs = 0.2 and 
ws = 0.05 (dimensionless aspect ratio parameters).

All temperatures are clipped at 5 K (and 800 K).


Sizes and Density profiles:
---------------------------
There's some anecdotal evidence (from Dullemond, Teague, and others) that the 
outer edges of the gas disks are fairly sharp, so the "end" of the 12CO really 
does appear to be something like 95% of the gas.  Dullemond et al. 2020 found 
this clearly in the HD 163296 disk kinematics, which go strong sub-Keplerian.  
Rich sees this too in TW Hya.  

So, let's assume that's right and adopt a modified similarity solution to 
accomodate it naturally, with gamma1 = 1.0 and gamma2 = 2.0.  For the 
characteristic radius, we rely on measurements of the mm - CO size scaling:

Rc set to Rmm(0.9mm) at 90%; meant to mimic Rco = 2.5 Rmm, accounting for high 
optical depths and exponential tail (uses ARA&A plot).  So,

Rc = 120 * (Mstar / Msun)**0.9 au.

To make sure that chemical effects do not introduce issues, we will use the 
'layered' abundance model, with Rout = 3 * Rc.  (See below on vertical layers.)

To normalize the density profile, I will assume an Mdisk that uses the mean 
relation in ARA&A and standard assumptions:

Mdisk = 0.02 * (Mstar / Msun)**1.7 Msun.

For this similarity solution form, this gives density profile normalizations 
(sig0) such that: 

model    Mstar	lgLstar	  Tmid0	  Rc	Mdisk	sig0
A	 0.3	-0.7814	  25.1	  40    0.003   3.00
B	 0.6	-0.3213   32.7    75    0.008   2.27
C	 0.9	-0.0224   38.9    110   0.017   2.24
D	 1.2	 0.1981   44.1    140   0.027   2.20
E	 1.5	 0.3818   49.0    170   0.040   2.21
F	 2.0	 0.6530   57.3    225   0.065   2.05
