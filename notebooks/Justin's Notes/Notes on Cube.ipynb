    "#### FITS\n",
    "* FITS file broken into segments called HDUs (Header/Data Units)\n",
    "    * First HDU is called Primary HDU, or Primary Array\n",
    "* The __data__ of a FITS file is stored in Primary HDU:\n",
    "   * usually either 1D spectrum, 2D array (image), or 3D cube\n",

    "#### Data Cubes\n",
    "* **Data cubes** have three parameters- 1 for velocity, and 2 for spatial position\n",
    "    * **Velocity**\n",
    "        * Emission distribution is broken down into 105 distinct velocities (channels)\n",
    "            * Cubes are visualized in slices of velocity, called a **channel map**\n",
    "            * Velocities of each channel maps are given as frequencies in FITS data:\n",

    "            $v = c \\ \\frac{1-f}{f_0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "            where $c$ is the speed of light, and $f_0$ is the rest frequency of whatever molecular emission you're looking at\n",

    "    * Velocity actually comes in the form os surface brightness (Given in units of mJy/beam)\n",
    "        * __Jansky:__ unit of spectral flux density\n",

    "            <blockquote>\n",
    "            The \"beam\" is a measure of the spatial resolution of the observations: it tells you how light from a point source (i.e., a source with infinitesimally small size) would be smeared out by the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "            * If (an) elliptical beam has a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) major axis of $a$ and a FWHM minor axis of $b$, the beam area being referenced is: $\\Omega_{\\rm beam} = \\frac{\\pi \\, a \\, b}{4 \\, \\ln{2}}$.\n",
    "            * Spectral radiance is related to brightness temperature by the following relation: $I_\\nu = B_\\nu(T_b)$\n",
    "                * In the low frequency, high temperature regime, when $h\\nu \\ll kT_b$, we can use the Rayleigh-Jeans law, giving the approximation: \n",

Usually moment$-1$ maps are shown on a diverging color scale (often with an appropriate red/blue pattern corresponding to redshifted and blueshifted sides of the disk).  This is sort of like a map of the (projected) disk rotation, in our particular case.\n",
