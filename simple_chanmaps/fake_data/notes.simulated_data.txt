[A] Make a template UVFITS file:

(1) Make a template cube on a given velocity grid, specified by the velocity
    half-span (vel_span), the channel width (ch_width), the systemic velocity 
    (vsys), and any other relevant parameters:

    > foo = mk_template_cube(vel_span, ch_width, vsys=vsys)

    [There are other keywords, but for our purposes these will remain fixed and
     are not reflected in the output filenames for record-keeping.]  
    This will produce a .FITS cube in template_cubes/.

(2) Make a simulated MS, and subsequently UVFITS file, in CASA:

    CASA> execfile('sim_alma.py')
    CASA> mk_template_uvfits(cube_filename.fits, conf=config, dt=time_in_mins,
                             vel_span=vel_span, ch_width=ch_width, vsys=vsys)

    This will produce a .UVFITS file in template_uvfits/.  It first runs 
    CASA/simobserve for the requested ALMA configuration and integration time, 
    and then will use CASA/mstransform to do any requested spectral 
    regridding.  If vel_span, ch_width are not specified (i.e., kept as None), 
    then CASA/mstransform will just use the same velocity channels as in the
    input cube.


[B] Make a simulated dataset using that template:
